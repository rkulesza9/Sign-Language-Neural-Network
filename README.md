# Sign-Language-Neural-Network
 	I created a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in tensorflow and trained it with Sign Language data from this Kaggle Dataset. I was able to tweak the network against the dataset to perform at 92% accuracy over the evaluation set. I saved the best performing model to file and by clicking the link, you can demo it here or view its code.
